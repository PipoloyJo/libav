Microsoft Visual Studio C conversion support
--------------------------------------------

Since Microsoft does not provide a C99 compliant compiler and does not show any interest in providing one
and apparently Microsoft Visual Studio users had silently complained about it for long, this section
provides a way to preprocess the Libav sources and enable people to compile natively the result.


Status
------

- The source converter is partially complete and some shortcomings are being worked around by hacking
  the codebase. Ideally help in supporting more C99 constructs is welcome

- The C99 headers provided from third parties are bundled for convenience

- The process requires unix tools, look at cygwin or msys for them.

- The project file generation is missing, contributions on this is more than welcome

- a Makefile target for the conversion is still missing

Usage
-----

Currently you have to manually build the c99-to-msvc processor, manually run the conversion script and
run the standard configure.

Donations
---------

Bounties and money offer to speedup the process are more than welcome, the core Libav team has no particular
interest in supporting a broken compiler, given than ICC, mingw64, LLVM/Clang are available on windows and
produce acceptable results for the target platform and seem to get a decent degree of integration on the
Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
